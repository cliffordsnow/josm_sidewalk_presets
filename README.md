Sidewalk presets for JOSM
When mapping separate sidewalks in JOSM having a specific set of presets is handy.

Thanks to @species for his work on https://github.com/species/josm-preset-wheelchair. All of the icons are his work.

The goal of these presets is to simplify the working of mapping sidewalks. Much of the work is somewhat tedious. Having all of the commonly used tags in one place helps speed up the work.

My [blog post](https://www.snowandsnow.us/articles/Mapping-Sidewalks/) might help those interested in mapping sidewalks as separate ways. The article was written before I discovered @species presets.
